    <h1>Research design</h1><br>
    <h3 id="descriptive">Descriptive</h3><br>
    <p>Descriptive research design aims to describe the distribution of variables without taking any causal or other hypotheses into account. 
      It is frequently used in quantitative research to answer the "What is....?" question. 
      When researchers want to gather a lot of data about people's experiences, beliefs, and attitudes through techniques like surveys or observations, descriptive research designs are frequently used.<br><br>

      In terms of research methodology, descriptive research designs are crucial because they lay the groundwork for comprehending the traits and distribution of variables in a population.
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="quasi-experimental">Quasi-experimental</h3><br>
    <p>Quasi-experimental research is research design that resembles experimental research but is not actually experimental research because the prefix quasi means "resembling". 
      Participants are not randomly assigned to conditions or orders of conditions, even though the independent variable is altered.<br><br>
	
      These designs offer advantages such as easier implementation in real-life settings and the ability to control for confounding variables. 
      However, it is important for researchers to carefully consider the purpose and objectives of their research when selecting and applying a quasi experimental design.
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="correlational">Correlational</h3><br>
    <p>A type of quantitative research technique called correlational research design looks at the degree and nature of relationships between two or more variables. 
      It is used to identify the presence and strength of relationships between variables, which can be helpful for testing hypotheses, bolstering theories, or disproving earlier hypotheses. 
      Because it describes current conditions, correlational research is frequently regarded as a descriptive research method.<br><br>

      It involves gathering data, and based on the most recent information and data, it can be used to predict and forecast events. 
      Limited causation claims should be made when using correlational research and data analysis, so researchers need to exercise caution.
    </p><br>

    <h3 id="experimental">Experimental</h3><br>
    <p>Experimental research design involves manipulating an independent variable and observing the impact it has on a dependent variable in order to study cause and effect relationships between variables. 
      The causal relationship is established through control mechanisms and empirical observation, making it the most scientific research methodology.<br><br>

      Drawing conclusions about causes and effects requires experimental research, which offers insightful information about behavioral patterns and underlying mechanisms. To choose the best experimental design, sampling strategy, measurement tools, statistical analyses, and data interpretation, researchers must carefully consider the purpose and objectives of their study.
