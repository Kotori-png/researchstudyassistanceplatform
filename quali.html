      <h1>Research design</h1><br>
      <h3 id="case">Case Study</h3><br>
      <p>A case study research design is a flexible method for fusing various data sources to create theories. 
        With a focus on "how" and "why" questions, it enables a comprehensive understanding of a subject within actual contexts.<br><br>
	
        In order to fully understand a limited framework or entity, such as a child, a teacher, or a program, the case study approach involves investigating it. 
        Case studies are used in research to clarify and broaden understanding, and they are especially helpful for gaining an appreciation for cultural landscapes.
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="ethnography">Ethnography</h3><br>
      <p>An ethnographic research design involves immersing oneself in a particular social setting in order to fully comprehend the customs and behaviors of the people who inhabit that setting. 
        Participant observation, in which the researcher interacts directly with the subjects and documents their observations, defines it. 
        Ethnography focuses on the root meanings, beliefs, and rules that control behavior in order to provide a comprehensive and empathetic understanding of social life.<br><br>
	
        It involves collecting thorough descriptions of social interactions and interpreting them according to their cultural setting. 
        The use of ethnographic research is applicable in many fields, including translation and interpreting, health and care services, and design research.
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="historical">Historical Study</h3><br>
      <p>To understand how the past has impacted the present and the future, historical research design is used in research studies. 
        It gives a foundation for comprehending the past, offers viewpoints for decision-making and policy formulation, and aids in comprehending present circumstances and practices. 
        Finding past trends and using them to predict present and future trends is another benefit of historical research.<br><br>
	 
        It can be done using a variety of frameworks, including public history, comparative history, content analysis, historical sociology, anthropology, and gender history. 
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="phenomology">Phenomology</h3><br>
      <p>A qualitative methodology known as "phenomenological research design" is used to ascertain how people perceive and comprehend a particular phenomenon. 
        In order to learn more about a particular phenomenon, it mainly focuses on investigating the individual experiences and interpretations of participants. 
        A broad term used to describe both a philosophical school of thought and a variety of research methodologies is phenomenology. 
        It focuses on the value of individual perspective and interpretation while attempting to provide answers to questions regarding the reality of a phenomenon.<br><br>

        Phenomenological research design is applied in various disciplines due to its philosophical and methodological strength.
      </p><br>

      <h3 id="grounded">Grounded Theory</h3><br>
      <p>A grounded theory research design is an inductive methodological strategy used in the social sciences with the goal of producing theory based on data that has been thoroughly gathered and examined.<br><br>

        Grounded theory bases its theories on reality in order to explain and comprehend social processes. Instead of testing hypotheses or describing phenomena, it entails coding data and creating theory from the data. 
        Participants in a grounded theory research design are able to identify their primary needs while the researcher investigates how to meet them, which causes the emergence of fundamental categories, concepts, or final theories.
